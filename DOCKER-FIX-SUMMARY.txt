RESONANCE.AI BREAKOUT SCANNER - DOCKER FIX SUMMARY
===================================================

FINAL WORKING PACKAGE: resonance-scanner-unraid-direct-paths-v12.5.tar.gz (2.3MB)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
============================

1. ‚ùå ORIGINAL ISSUE: "sh: vite: not found"
   ‚úÖ FIXED: Added --include=dev to npm install to install build tools

2. ‚ùå SECOND ISSUE: Production build path.resolve() error  
   ‚úÖ FIXED: Switched to development mode to avoid bundling issues

3. ‚ùå THIRD ISSUE: "import.meta.dirname" undefined in vite.config.ts  
   ‚úÖ FIXED: Added docker-startup-fix.sh that patches vite.config.ts automatically

4. ‚ùå FOURTH ISSUE: "import.meta.dirname" undefined in server/vite.ts (Web UI error)
   ‚úÖ FIXED: Updated startup script to patch BOTH vite.config.ts AND server/vite.ts

5. ‚ùå FIFTH ISSUE: "Permission denied" on docker-startup-fix.sh (restart loop)
   ‚úÖ FIXED: Added chmod +x to set execute permissions before running script

6. ‚ùå SIXTH ISSUE: "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/client/index.html'" (persistent)
   ‚úÖ FIXED: Direct hardcoded Docker paths to eliminate all path calculation errors

ROOT CAUSE:
===========
- Docker node:18-alpine doesn't support import.meta.dirname in tsx
- SEVEN total references across two files: vite.config.ts (5) AND server/vite.ts (2)
- vite.config.ts caused container restart loop
- server/vite.ts caused Web UI TypeError on page load  
- Complex path.join operations were failing in Docker environment
- Path calculation errors causing '/client/index.html' instead of '/app/client/index.html'
- Extracted tar.gz files don't preserve execute permissions in Docker

SOLUTION:
=========
- Added chmod +x to set execute permissions on startup script
- Direct hardcoded Docker paths: "/app/client/index.html" and "/app/dist/public"
- Eliminates all path calculation errors by using absolute paths
- Comprehensive patching of ALL 7 import.meta.dirname references
- Multiple fallback patterns to ensure successful replacement
- Verification system confirms all patches applied successfully  
- No manual file editing required
